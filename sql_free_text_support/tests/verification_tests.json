       "document": "Place in Palo Alto downtown that has been there for ages. The decor is great. Parking is as parking is in Palo Alto downtown. So go earlier than you intended and try to look for parking nearby.   Couple of things, don't believe Google when it tells you the price range is 20-30 because it is closer to 40-50.  They prefer if you make a reservation but we were able to walk off the street pretty immediately.  I do have a few complaints: Food wasn't very good. The tip about never eating seafood toward the end of the week is accurate. I got a seafood pasta dish and it tasted heavily of old fish which is not what you want. The pasta itself was ok but not something I would rave about.  They sat us right at the fire escape door which meant that I could only back my chair up so much and I had to be careful how I moved so that I didn't trigger the door. The table is awkwardly placed  so my friend tried to give me more room but that just put them into the way of the wait staff.  Service itself is spotty. Depending who you get, you can get a waitress who is friendly, smiling, checks on you to see how you like the food or barely interacts with you and is just there to do their job. Sadly we got the latter.   Would I recommend this place? I'm hesitant. Maybe if you make a reservation and get great service, then yes. There are enough reviews to know it can be a great dining experience. I personally did not care for the experience.",

        "document": "Boy oh boy. I haven't had hummus this silky and addicting since ...  Hmm. Since ... never!   Their hummus bowls are varied and you wouldn't be amiss with choosing a veggie or meat option. I love love love the Sabich with its fried eggplant, potatoes and hard boiled egg in the mix. Their fluffy pita is the perfect vehicle to scoop up the thick, unique style of Jaffa hummus. Always get it this style! It's made with garlic and pine nuts. SO GOOD.   Of course, being located in Town & Country, parking can be a challenge to find and lunch time can be quite busy and overrun with teeny boppers thanks to a nearby high school. And expect prices to be outrageous (yes , $12 to $16 range) but it's PA, so what do you expect?   Just look at that hummus though.",

Typical price range for a SF shop, $8 reg. $12 super burritos, 2 large tacos round $8 but only one tortilla for each taco usually other taqueria's give you two tortillas for one taco. Could have made 4 regular size tacos for that order.  Good taste, good portion sizes. All n' all nice small shop when craving tacos, burritos and nachos.",

After seeing the beautiful photos on Yelp, I couldn't wait to try brunch here!  Book ahead as reservations are recommended and frankly needed for weekend brunch.  The outside dining patio didn't disappoint - it has a beautiful little fountain and beautiful intimate table settings.  So pretty!  The food itself was ok, along the lines of what one would expect from conference/event food.  Edible but not memorable or worth the calories.  I probably wouldn't return again because of the mediocre food and pet policy but I did want to call out the great service and the gentleman greeter - there was a mistake on our res and I was confused about some rules but he was so accommodating that he turned a potentially disappointing experience into a pleasant one - thank you so much!  Note - even though there is a huge outdoor eating space, the building owners do not allow pets (pets not welcome signs everywhere) so unfortunately the restaurant doesn't allow pets either.  While I will respect the building's pet policy, I won't return as I love being with my pets too much!  Plenty of pet friendly establishments in the area.",

They have an assortment of freshly baked pastries, yummy sandwiches, and basic espresso drinks (and cold brew).  You'll find lots of locals and regulars here.  -- Food --  This is mainly a bakery -- and it's a good one. The chef bakes an assortment of Italian pastries daily. Their cornettos are to die for, and they're made with a bunch of different fillings and toppings.  For a heartier meal, they also have an assortment of pre-made sandwiches on fresh focaccia or cornetto.   -- Drinks --  Poesia Café has basic espresso drinks (think cappuccinos, lattes, etc -- but no pumpkin spice lattes here) and a few iced coffee options (cold brew, etc).   -- Atmosphere -- The cafe has a cosy interior with roughly 20 small tables, filled with art from local artists. The outdoor space is very cute and sunny, with roughly 5-8 tables surrounded by plants.   The staff are very friendly and I've always felt welcomed with exceptional service.   Both the indoor and outdoor areas are dog friendly.  -- Stars -- Food: 3/3 Stars Atmosphere: 1/1 Stars Drinks: 1/1 Stars Total: 5/5 Stars",

The food and service turned out to be excellent, and I highly recommend you giving this place a try if you like Thai food. The live DJ never did appear. I ordered Rama Thai chicken with peanut sauce, and our lovely server was kind enough to allow a change in the vegetable. It was delicious and cooked just right. Again, I highly recommend you go try this place!",
